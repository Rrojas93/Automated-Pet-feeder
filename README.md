# Automated-Pet-feeder
Digital 3 Project: Automated Pet feeder

This project was designed to be able to feed a house pet (dog or cat) automatically based on a user set schedule. The project was built with a Raspberry Pi 2b in C. The use of "WiringPi" (http://wiringpi.com/) libraries aided in the use of the general purpose input/output pins of the RPi along with other helpful functions. The project was a success and was fully physically built, tested, and demonstrated. The physical project was chosen among a few others to be displayed in the display case of the Engineering building of the Kennesaw State University, Marietta Campus for exemplorary work.
